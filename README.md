# Simple Hand Gesture Recognition Code
It's a simple hand gesture recognition system.

It's good, it's working and it's free.

Feel free to use this code in your applications.

If you want to give me any credits I would be grateful, but you don't have to.

To run it open the project in QT. You will need the openCV library to be able to run it.
